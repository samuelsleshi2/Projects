   <h2>About</h2>
   <p>My name is Samuel Sleshi, and this is my personal website! Some fun facts about me 
    are that I play basketball, I'm a great cook, and I am the tallest in my family. I was born in Alexandria, Virginia
    and still live in Virginia.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I am a senior attending South County High School in Lorton, Virginia. I am currently taking 5 AP courses
    right now. I have attended South County for all four years of high school and I am an FCA leader and a member
    of my school's Ethiopian Eritrean Alliance. I plan on studying computer science in college.
